# 📚 Libft

**Libft** is a foundational C library project from the 42 Network curriculum. It consists of reimplementing a set of standard C library functions as well as additional utility functions, aiming to deepen understanding of C programming and prepare for future projects.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Reimplement common C standard library functions such as `strlen`, `strcpy`, `memset`, etc.
- Create useful utility functions like string manipulation, memory management, and linked list operations
- Gain mastery over pointers, memory allocation, and low-level C programming
- Build a reusable library to use in later projects

---

## 🔧 Features

- Reimplementation of 42+ standard functions (string, memory, character checks, etc.)  
- Custom functions for linked list management (`t_list`), including creation, deletion, iteration, and mapping  
- Functions follow norm coding style enforced by 42  
- Fully commented and tested

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- C language  
- Makefile for compiling static library (`libft.a`)  
- Unix/Linux environment
